Notes

The tasks.json file is automatically created if it doesn't exist.
Task IDs are based on the order shown in the list command (1-based indexing).
Invalid task IDs will result in an error message.
Use this tool in any directory where you want to manage tasks; a new tasks.json will be created there if needed.
